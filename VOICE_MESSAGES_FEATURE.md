## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Added `voice_url` column to `match_chat` table for storing audio file URLs
- Added `voice_duration` column to store message duration in seconds
- Extended `message_type` enum to include 'voice' type
- Created database trigger for cleanup of voice message files

### API Updates
- Added `sendVoiceMessage` function to chat API
- Integrated with Supabase storage for audio file uploads
- Extended `MatchChatMessage` interface to support voice properties

### UI Components
- **Voice Recording Button**: Microphone icon button to start recording

- **Voice Player**: Audio playback controls with progress bar
- **Voice Message Display**: Special rendering for voice messages in chat

### Recording Process
1. User clicks microphone button
2. System requests microphone permission (if not already granted)
3. MediaRecorder starts capturing audio in WebM format
4. Recording timer shows elapsed time
5. User clicks stop button to finish recording
6. Audio blob is uploaded to Supabase storage
7. Voice message record is created in database
8. Message appears in chat with playback controls

### Audio Features
- **Format**: WebM with Opus codec for wide browser support
- **Storage**: Supabase storage bucket for audio files
- **Playback**: HTML5 Audio API with custom controls
- **Progress**: Visual progress bar showing playback position

## Usage Instructions

3. **Stop Recording**: Click the stop button (square icon)
4. **Voice Message Sent**: Message appears in chat with play button
5. **Listen to Voice Messages**: Click play button on received voice messages

### For Developers
- Voice messages are stored as 'voice' type in `match_chat` table
- Audio files are stored in Supabase storage under `voice_messages/` path
- Voice message URLs are public and accessible via Supabase CDN
- Recording uses MediaRecorder API with WebM format

## Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support (iOS 14.3+)
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Mobile**: Supported on modern mobile browsers

## Security Features
- Microphone permission required before recording
- RLS policies ensure only match participants can send/receive voice messages
- Audio files are stored securely in Supabase storage
- Voice message URLs are public but non-enumerable

## Performance Considerations
- Audio files are compressed using Opus codec for smaller file sizes
- Voice messages are optimized for real-time transmission
- Database indexes added for efficient voice message queries
- Cleanup triggers prevent storage bloat from deleted messages

## Error Handling
- Microphone permission denied: User-friendly error message
- Recording failures: Graceful fallback with error notification
- Upload failures: Retry mechanism with user feedback
- Playback errors: Silent fallback with error logging

## Future Enhancements
- Voice message transcription
- Voice message length limits
- Voice message editing/deletion
- Voice message forwarding
- Voice message search functionality
