-- Fix match deletion constraint issues
-- The problem is that triggers fire during CASCADE operations and try to insert new chat messages
-- into a match that's being deleted, causing foreign key constraint violations

-- First, let's modify the match leave trigger to NOT fire during cascade operations
-- We'll detect cascade operations by checking if the match still exists
